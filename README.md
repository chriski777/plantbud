# PlantBud
A buddy to help you plant.

## Who's it for?

PlantBud is a suite of tools meant for individuals who have always wanted to venture into agriculture but lacked the necessary expertise and resources to dive in. Our target audience consists of individuals with very little to no farming skills that have limited access to agriculture education. Although PlantBud can be used by anyone interested in gardening, this software intends to primarily cater to members of marginalized populations that face difficulty in receiving a formal education in agriculture. This application is meant to help those determined greenhorn planters blossom into seasoned horticulturists. 


### Why would anyone use this?

Nowadays, most people that want to start gardening either take formal classes or spend a lot of time reading relevant books/websites on proper planting practices. This obstructs many individuals, especially those of marginalized populations from entering the gardening world, as these people simply don't have the resources and time to learn about gardening skills. PlantBud is meant to streamline the learning process by providing only the relevant and necessary information to new and inexperienced planters.
